The Flyve MDM Agent for Android allows you to manage the Android devices of your fleet from the dashboard.

Flyve MDM is a Mobile device management software that enables you to secure and manage all the mobile devices of your business or family.

You can join the community in GitHub and participate to contribute, test and correct bugs: [Flyve MDM on GitHub](https://github.com/flyve-mdm)!

## 1. Invite the user

Once the invitation is sent from the dashboard...

### MQ Telemetry Transport

We implemented the MQTT protocol, which is useful for connections with remote locations since it was designed as an extremely lightweight message transport. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers. Thanks to it, the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend.
