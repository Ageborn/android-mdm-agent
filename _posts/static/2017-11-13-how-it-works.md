The Agent will take control of the Android devices of your fleet allowing you to manage all the terminals by implementing the commands given through the dashboard.

Therefore the Agent must be installed in the devices of your IT Infrastructure, you send an invitation to enroll and after the process is finished, you will be able to control the fleet through the dashboard.

Thanks to the MQTT, a Machine to Machine protocol, the Agent is capable of maintaining a connection with the backend, which gives you remote control of your fleet.

The Agent counts with an intuitive and simple User Interface which will help you through the enrollment process.
